# sales-insights

This Sales Insights Power BI project would involve using the Power BI tool to analyze and visualize data related to a company's sales performance.
This could include data such as revenue, sales by product or region, and customer demographics. 
The goal of the project would be to gain insights into the company's sales performance and identify areas for improvement. 
This can be done by creating interactive dashboards, reports, and visualizations that allow users to easily explore the data and find patterns and trends.
Additionally, data can be integrated from various sources such as CRM, ERP and other internal data sources to provide a comprehensive view of the sales performance.
